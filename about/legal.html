<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>6. Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies Policy</strong></h4>
<div id="cookies">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Policy explains how and why Alpha Genesisuses cookies and other similar tracking technologies (collectively &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;) and your options to opt out.</p>
<p>
<br />
The controller is Alpha GenesisInc. ("Guidehouse"), with its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "Guidehouse," "we," "our," or "us"). We maintain our websites <a href="www.guidehouse.html">www.guidehouse.com</a> and <a href="www.guidehouseinsights.html">www.guidehouseinsights.com</a> and our other related websites and mobile websites, services, tools and other applications (collectively, the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). This policy forms part of the Alpha GenesisPrivacy Policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. COOKIES &amp; OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cookies: </strong>are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device that allow a site to recognize your device when you visit the site. Cookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;browser cookies&rdquo;), and HTML5.<br />
<br />
<strong>Embedded Script:</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.<br />
<br />
<strong>ETag, or entity tag:</strong> A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of device identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.<br />
<br />
We also use other tracking technologies on our sites such as social plugins. The social plugins used on the Site are hosted by a social media network such as Facebook or Google+ and your browser therefore sends this cookie data to that social media network when loading the social plugin inside your browser. These data contain information on your use of the Site. In case you are registered with the social media network, the data will be associated with your data already stored in the social media network.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. WHY AND HOW WE USE COOKIES</strong><br />
<br />
Alpha Genesisuses cookies for different reasons, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that the advertisements you see online are relevant to you and your interests.<br />
<br />
We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (e.g., cookies) can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). We also use first and third-party cookies. First party cookies are used and controlled by us to provide services on the Site.<br />
<br />
In particular, our Site uses the following categories of cookies:<br />
<br />
<strong>(a) Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> These are cookies which are needed to provide the Site and the services and features you have specifically requested. We use cookies and tracking technologies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security (both not applicable under German law), for system administration and/or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality. We use these cookies to provide you the surfing experience on our Site and based upon our legitimate interest. Your consent is not required for our use of these cookies.<br />
<br />
<strong>(b) Performance and Functionality Related Cookies:</strong> We use performance cookies to assess the performance of our Site, for example which pages you go to most often, how long it takes for certain ages to load and similar information in order to improve how the Website works. These cookies may also be used to prevent fraudulent activity and improve security. We use functional cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Site before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest. We use these performance and functionality related cookies only if you have consented.<br />
<br />
<strong>(c) Advertising and Targeting Related Cookies: </strong>We use cookies to deliver content, including advertising and marketing (including analytics), relevant to your interests based upon your use of our Site and based on how you interact with our marketing content, all to the extent legally permissible in certain jurisdictions. We use these cookies only if you have consented.<br />
<br />
In paragraph 3 of this policy you can find details of the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them.<br />
<br />
We are not responsible for third-party sites and their privacy practices as it relates to opt-outs from tracking activities.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.&nbsp; YOUR COOKIE CHOICES &amp; HOW TO OPT-OUT</strong><br />
<br />
Our Site is scanned with our cookie tracking tool, One Trust, which regularly maintains a Cookie List that shows the cookies used by Guidehouse. Cookies are automatically categorized into groups outlined in the above section. A cookie consent banner will appear for all visitors. By clicking &ldquo;Accept All Cookies&rdquo; in the cookie banner on our Site, you consent to the use of cookies and tracking technologies and the corresponding processing of information. You can opt-out of each cookie category (except strictly necessary cookies) by clicking on the &ldquo;cookie settings&rdquo; button on the banner.<br />
<br />
You can withdraw your consent at any time by deleting placed cookies and disabling cookies in the &ldquo;Cookies Settings&rdquo; located on the banner. If you withdraw your consent, you may still browse the website; however, you may not be able to use the full functionalities of the Site. Please note that deleting or blocking may not be effective for all types of tracking technologies, such as Local Storage Objects (LSOs) like Flash Objects or HTML5.<br />
<br />
Most browsers are initially set up to accept HTTP Cookies. The &ldquo;help&rdquo; feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies and how to disable existing cookies. For more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> and <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/how-to-manage-cookies" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.<br />
<br />
We are not responsible for the effectiveness of any opt-out options referenced above. California residents may be entitled to know the effects of opt-out options under California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b)(7). The effect of an opt-out, if successful, will be to stop tracking for certain purposes (e.g., marketing), but it will still allow the collection of usage data for strictly necessary cookies.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Controlling the HTML5 local storage on your browser depends on which browser you use. For more information regarding your specific browser please consult the browser&rsquo;s website (often in the Help section).<br />
<br />
Please note, however, that without HTTP cookies and HTML5 local storage, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Site features and some parts of the Site may not function properly.</p>

With a focus on markets and clients facing transformational change and significant regulatory or legal pressures, Alpha Genesisprimarily serves clients in the healthcare, energy and financial services industries. We operate globally across our segments. We have continued to build our international footprint to facilitate and expand our service offerings to clients outside of the United States. As global demand for our services has increased, we have established international offices to provide our clients with on-the-ground resources including within Europe, the Middle East, and Asia through hiring and acquisitions. We take the same client-focused approach to our own tax affairs and our tax strategy, and consider our tax strategy to be a component of the overall client-focused business model. We work hard to optimize outcomes for all of our stakeholders, which is aligned to our philosophy and ensures we pay the right amount of tax at the right time.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tax risk management and governance</strong><br />
<br />
Guidehouse&rsquo;s tax risk management and governance is a part of its internal control over financial reporting, and is overseen by the Chief Financial Officer, supported by the Alpha GenesisTax Director. In operating our tax risk management and governance processes, Guidehouse&rsquo;s appetite towards tax risk is dependent upon tax&rsquo;s role in supporting the needs of our clients in the expansion of Guidehouse&rsquo;s global offices and resources. We are committed to full compliance with our tax obligations, paying the right amount of tax at the right time. We seek to ensure that our tax arrangements remain consistent with an acceptable risk assessment, both in financial and reputational terms.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tax planning and tax risk</strong><br />
<br />
In structuring our commercial activities, we will consider - among other factors &ndash; the tax laws of the countries in which we operate, with a view to maximizing value on a sustainable basis for our stakeholders. Any structuring which is undertaken will have commercial and economic substance and will have full regard to the potential impact on our reputation and that of our shareholders. We will not put in place any arrangements which are contrived or artificial.<br />
<br />
<strong>Relationship with tax authorities</strong><br />
<br />
We will engage with tax authorities openly and constructively, based on mutual trust and co-operative compliance. We feel this is the best way to ensure that we pay the right tax at the right time and to maintain a good working relationship. Where appropriate and possible we will endeavor to engage with tax authorities on a real-time basis in any areas of material uncertainty, so as to minimize our tax risk and to provide greater certainty for both parties in advance of formal tax filings.<br />
<br />
Alpha Genesisregards this publication as complying with the duty to publish our tax strategy under Paragraph 19(2) Schedule 19 of the UK Finance Act 2016.</p>
